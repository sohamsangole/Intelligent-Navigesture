## 🔮Future Scope
Hand tracking technology has significant potential for future growth and development, and here are some of the future scope of hand tracking:
1.	Virtual and Augmented Reality: Hand tracking will likely play a larger role in the development of virtual and augmented reality technologies, providing users with more intuitive and natural ways to interact with virtual objects and environments.
2.	Human-Computer Interaction: Hand tracking revolutionise how humans interact with computers and other digital devices, making the experience more natural and intuitive.
3.	Gaming: Hand tracking is likely to become increasingly popular in the gaming industry, allowing players to control games using hand gestures and movements.
4.	Healthcare: Hand-tracking technology can be used to develop new rehabilitation and therapy tools for individuals with hand injuries or disabilities.
5.	Automation: Hand tracking can be used to control industrial robots and other automated systems, providing a safer and more flexible alternative to traditional control methods.
These are just a few of the potential future applications of hand tracking technology, and as the field continues to advance, it is likely that new and innovative uses will emerge.

## 💸Applications
Hand tracking can be used as an alternative input method for controlling a mouse on a computer. Here are some potential usage scenarios for hand tracking in this context:
1.	Accessibility: Hand tracking can provide a more accessible option for individuals with disabilities that make it difficult to use a traditional mouse.
2.	Gaming: In gaming, hand tracking can provide a more immersive experience by allowing players to control the game using hand gestures.
3.	Productivity: Hand tracking can provide a more ergonomic and natural way to interact with a computer, potentially reducing strain and increasing productivity for users who spend long periods of time using a mouse.
4.	Presentations: In presentations, hand tracking can be used to interact with slides, providing a more dynamic and engaging experience for the audience.
